This wrappergen tool is called every time a library is compiled; every time
"wrappergen foo" is called it reads the file libs/foo/foo.h0 and writes the
file libs/foo/foo_c0ffi.c. The parts dealing with this process are in 
load_h0.sml.

In addition, there is a permanent cache of all library files in lib/c0ffi.list.
If the library and its member functions are any different than the ones in 
that cache, then wrappergen will also refersh a bunch of other files:
 - lib/c0ffi.list
 - vm/c0vm_c0ffi.h
 - vm/c0vm_c0ffi.c
 - compiler/c0vm/c0vm-c0vffi.sml
The parts dealing with this process are in c0ffi.list.sml.
