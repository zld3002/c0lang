This is intended to be a list of simple, algorithmically enforceable
rules. This is not an exhaustive guide to style! Not all of these
errors will be caught by the `-w` flag in `cc0`, but anything caught
by the `-w` flag should be describable in terms of one of these
errors.

1) Lines should be at most 80 characters long. (Overly-long lines show
up horribly in Autolab.)

2) Tab characters should not be used anywhere. (This, in particular,
is not a universal rule of style, but various pieces of the course
infrastructure - especially Autolab - show tabs differently, so we
don't use tabs in 122.)

3) Top-level declarations should not be indented.

4) Indention should be the same across a set of commands in the same
block.

```
No: {
      int x = y+1;
       y--;
      ...
    }
No: { 
       int x = y+1;
      y--;
      ...
    }   
```

5) Indention in functions and loops should be at least two characters wide.

```
No: while (x < n) 
    x++;
No: while (x < n) {
     x++;
    }
OK: while (x < n) {
      x++;
    }
OK: while (x < n) 
    {
      x++;
    }
OK: while (x < n) 
    //loop_invariant 0 <= x;
    {
      x++;
    }
OK: while (x < n) 
      //loop_invariant 0 <= x;
      {
        x++;
      }
```
