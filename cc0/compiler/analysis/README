ANAYLSIS: Various useful analyzes on C0 source
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Files
  preprocess.sml: expands types, re-assigns parallel definitions, etc. to make
                  analysis more uniform.
  ananysisast.sml: an AST in SSA form.
  error.sml: Representation of verification errors
  analysis.sml: Converts from a regular AST to an AAST, by performing SSA.
  env.sml: SSA calculation helper environment.
  nullity.sml: Safety analysis which attempts to protect null dereferences.
  safety.sml: Generic safety analysis, handles control flow
  purity.sml: Checks annotation functions for externally visible effects.
  top.sml: Top level functions for invoking the purity and safety analyzes.
  conditions.sml: Interface for using Z3 to SAT-solve verifications.
  vcgen.sml: Verification of contracts and other potential errors.

Current Issues:
  -Isolation will cause problems for some programs if the special lv &= e 
  statement is generated.
  -Nullity checks do not track heap locations or use other function's
  posconditions.
  -SSA conversion is exponential in the number of nested loops.
  -Purity check does not say where the function is called to require purity.
  -Purity checker is very uncommented.
