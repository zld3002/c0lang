0.1.1 --> 0.1.2
Jan 11, 2011: Reconfigured to use Spring 2011 variant of C0 and C0 compiler.

0.1.2 --> 0.1.3
Jan 11, 2011: Added versioning information
              Changed prompt from ">>>" to "-->" to distinguish from Python
              Added support for pragmas, though you can't actually #load.

0.1.3 --> 0.1.4
Jan 12, 2011: Fixed overzealous pragma parsing
              Fixed octal number error messages to allow `0'
              Introduced typechecking
              Made top-level declarations with assignment atomic, so that no
              variable is introduced in scope if the expression aborts.
              Assignments now print out the assigned value
              The expression is printed back out when entered on the toplevel
              Improve value printout
              Forbid "return" in the interactive toplevel

0.1.5 --> 0.1.6
Jan 14, 2011: Integrate compiler infrastructrue

              Search paths for the implementation of native libraries
              Handling of native functions, somewhat
              Fix printing of strings
              Change (improve?) #help message
              Implement #reload

0.2.2 --> 0.2.3
Jan 16, 2011: Add #functions, #structs, and #locals pragmas to Coin
              Fixed problem with function calls not expanding typedefs
              Change codename from "Pfennig" to "Penny" to avoid confusing
              the students, who have mostly thought it's "Pfenning" misspelled

0.2.3 --> 0.2.4
Jan 21, 2011: Fixed bug reported by Frank and William: function calls depended
              on incorrect information
Feb 3, 2011:  Fixed bug reported by Karl: stack depth not reset when native
              functions called. Also improved --trace messages, adding depth.
Feb 4, 2011:  Make logical and/or parts of the internal language rather than
              relying on ternary operator, also add parens in pretty-printing
              of ternary operatory.
Feb 11, 2011: Improved reporting of unitialized value errors
              Made dynamic semantics errors more extreme, since they should be
              precluded by typechecking in all instances.

0.2.4 --> 0.2.5
Feb 15, 2011: Typedefs now (correctly) expanded recursively, bug reported
              by Karl Naden and Sean Donegan.

0.2.5 --> 0.2.6
Feb 23, 2011: Fixed terrible allocation bug that had existed in bare runtime
              Added dynamic check to getting rid of variables at interface
              Fixed bug where calling.sml was not expanding typedefs fully

0.2.6 --> 0.2.7
May 12, 2011: Null pointers were occasionally raising a dynamic typing error
              instead of a null pointer exception.
              Fix problems with function calls involving arrays
              Distinguish negative sized array errors
              Fix sign conversion issues for integers. 
              Show caller when @requires assertions are violated
Jun 6, 2011:  Make chars display as '\0' not '\000'
              Refuse to print straings with non-displayable characters in
              Coin (these can appear thanks to the string library)

0.2.7 --> 0.2.8
Aug 19, 2011: Change native interface to remove assembly code dependency
              Refactor dependencies between cymbol and coin

0.2.8 --> 0.2.9
Oct 25, 2011: Rewrite coin.sml to use the parse3 architecture
              Make the main coin operation a bit less stateful

0.2.9 --> 0.2.10
Jan 13, 2011: Fix bug where the second argument to alloc_array was evaluated
              two times.

0.2.10 --> 0.3.0
Feb 6, 2011:  Modify implementation to support different foreign
              functions.
Mar 3, 2011:  Experimental Cygwin compatibility
May 5, 2012:  Hack to allow pointer offsets in isolated code (cymbol)
Aug 20, 2012: Finish getting code isolation to work at the top-level
Aug 25, 2012: Modify state's typechecking so that NULLs can be given
              their true type when reported on the top-level. Corner
              case: a NULL returned from a function doesn't currently
              know its type; this can be corrected by having Coin's
              bytecode compilation aware of the return types of
              functions.
Aug 25, 2012: Fix #functons printing bug associated with the -d option

0.3.0 --> 0.3.1
Aug 29, 2012: Fix bug - isolation at coin's toplevel did not use
              annotations and did not eliminate for-loops, which
              caused isolation to raise Match.
Aug 29, 2012: Isolation means the default location actually shows up
              sometimes; make this less hideous and
              bug-report-inducing.

0.3.1 --> 0.3.2
Dec 26, 2012: Get static analysis working in Coin
Dec 26, 2012: Fix depth-tracking bug

              runtime.

0.3.2 --> 0.3.3
Jan 8, 2015:  Mark C1 features as non-supported, update FFI
Jan 20, 2015: Fix long-standing bug with for loops
