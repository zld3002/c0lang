By Rob Simmons and Jakob Uecker
A collection of tools for parsing, manipulating, interpreting, and symbolically
evaluating the C0 programming language.

cymbol-tools/core/sources.{cm,mlb}
 - Parsing c0
 - Specification of the c0 memory model
 - Abstract implementations of the c0 memory model
 - High-level dynamic semantics for c0 (expressions and simple statements)

cymbol-tools/cfg/sources.{cm,mlb}
 - Elaboration of C0 into control flow graphs
 - CFG manipulation
 - Concrete operational semantics using these control flow graphs
