There are many people who supported me in my work.

First, I would like to thank my advisor Frank Pfenning for his guidance,
feedback, and funding this past year. I would also like to thank Mark Stehlik
for serving on my thesis committee.

Rob Simmons, William Lovas, and Roger Wolff were willing at all times to discuss
all ideas and implementation ideas. Michael Sullivan, Max Buevich, and Dan
Schafer also gave me good feedback during the development of \langname{}. Their
feedback was invaluable in helping me in this endeavor.

I want to extend a special thanks to Deborah Cavlovich for helping me sort out
all the administrative details and issues.

Finally I want to thank my parents, sister and grandmother for their support of
my education over the years.
